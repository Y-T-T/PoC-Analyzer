**PoC Analyzer** is a specialized static analysis tool designed for Cybersecurity Researchers, Red Teamers, and Protocol Engineers. 

Unlike traditional SAST tools that search for *vulnerabilities* in code, PoC Analyzer scans for **Malicious Intent**. It is built to validate third-party Proof-of-Concept (PoC) scripts downloaded from GitHub, Exploit-DB, or other public sources, ensuring they do not contain hidden backdoors, reverse shells, or malware droppers before you execute them.

## Features

* **Multi-Language Support**: Native support for **Python, Node.js, Go, PHP, Java, C/C++, Shell, Batch, and PowerShell**.
* **Heuristic Scoring Engine**: Calculates a "Risk Score" based on weighted behaviors (e.g., Obfuscation = High Risk, Socket Connection = Low Risk) rather than simple keyword matching.
* **AST-Based Analysis**: Powered by [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), allowing it to understand code structure and detect obfuscated patterns (e.g., `eval(base64...)`) that regex often misses.
* **Smart Deduplication**: Automatically groups duplicate findings to prevent score inflation, ensuring accurate risk assessment.
* **Rich Reporting**: Generates beautiful, easy-to-read terminal reports with clear verdicts (SAFE / SUSPICIOUS / MALICIOUS).

## Project Structure

To ensure the analyzer works correctly, organize your directory as follows:

```text
PoC-Analyzer/
├── PoC_Analyzer.py            # Main Analysis Engine
├── README.md                  # Documentation
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
├── test_samples.zip           # Encrypted test samples (password: infected)
└── rules/                     # Semgrep Rule Definitions
    ├── common.yaml        # Cross-language secrets IoCs
    ├── c.yaml             # C/C++ rules
    ├── php.yaml           # PHP specific rules
    ├── python.yaml        # Python specific rules
    ├── js.yaml            # JavaScript/Node.js rules
    ├── go.yaml            # Go rules

## ⚠️ Test Samples
The test cases are encrypted to prevent antivirus false positives. Unzip test_samples.zip in Sandbox environment with password: `infected` to run the tests.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Y-T-T/PoC-Analyzer.git
cd PoC-Analyzer
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Basic Scan (Recommended)

By default, the analyzer scans the target file using all rules found in the local `rules/` directory. It automatically filters rules based on the file extension.

```bash
python PoC_Analyzer.py poc.py
```

### 2. Scan with Specific Configuration

You can specify a custom rule file or a different directory.

```bash
python PoC_Analyzer.py -c rules/js.yaml poc.js
```

### 3. Adjust Sensitivity

The default risk threshold is **150**. You can adjust this to be more aggressive or lenient.

```bash
# Strict mode: Any score above 80 is considered MALICIOUS
python PoC_Analyzer.py -c rules/shell.yaml -t 80 poc.sh
```

## Risk Scoring Logic

The analyzer assigns a verdict based on the calculated **Risk Score**.

| Verdict | Icon | Condition | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SAFE** | ✅ | Score < Threshold / 2 | Low risk. Likely a legitimate PoC or tool. |
| **SUSPICIOUS** | ⚠️ | Score ≥ Threshold / 2 | Contains some dangerous patterns (e.g., system calls), but lacks definitive malicious intent. Manual review recommended. |
| **MALICIOUS** | 🚨 | Score ≥ Threshold | **High Risk.** Clear indicators of backdoor behavior (e.g., Reverse Shell, Obfuscated Execution, Droppers). |

### Scoring Examples

* **Socket Connection (`socket`)**: +10 (Essential for many PoCs)
* **System Command (`os.system`)**: +30 (Common in RCE PoCs)
* **Obfuscation (`base64 decode`)**: +50 (Suspicious)
* **Reverse Shell Pattern**: **+100 (Critical Malicious Indicator)**

*Example:* A script containing `eval()` (+50), `base64` (+50), and a network connection (+10) would score **110**. With a threshold of 100, this would be flagged as **MALICIOUS**.
